Join us in this hands-on tutorial to dive into the world of Sirius Web, the cutting-edge technology that brings modeling capabilities to the web. In this interactive session, participants will gain practical experience in coding web-based modeling tools using Sirius Web, enabling users to visualize, edit, and analyze complex models directly in their web browsers.

This tutorial is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to Sirius Web and equip participants with the skills needed to develop their own web-based modeling tools. We will guide you through the entire process, from setting up the development environment to deploying and running a fully functional Sirius Web application.

Throughout the tutorial, you will:

* Explore the architecture and components of Sirius Web to understand how they work together.
* Define a metamodel and specify graphical notations for your models.
* Create and customize diagram editors.
* Implement custom behaviors and validations to tailor the application to your specific needs.
* Enable collaborative editing and real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on the same models simultaneously.
* Deploy and run your Sirius Web based application, making it accessible to users through their web browsers.

Participants will gain hands-on experience and practical insights into building powerful web-based modeling tools using Sirius Web.

So, come join us in this tutorial and let's practice Sirius Web together!

Installation instructions:

* Follow the instructions at : https://github.com/eclipse-sirius/sirius-components#building
* For unprepared participants, we will provide USB sticks containing the necessary software and materials for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* The tutorial will also be fully demonstrated by a team member on a large screen for those who do not wish to perform the steps themselves.

*Objective of the presentation*: Building web-based modeling tools using Sirius Web.
*Attendee pre-requisites*: Prior knowledge of modeling concepts and web development basics would be beneficial but not mandatory.
